<h3 id="A-Simple-Example">A Simple Example<a class="anchor-link" href="#A-Simple-Example">&#182;</a></h3><p>Imagine we want to predict housing prices.</p>
<p>We'd probably start with a spreadsheet of prices we know to be true, alongside features for each house that we expect to be related to the price.</p>
<p>If we plot price vs. size on this toy dataset, we can start to see a slope:</p>

<p>The <strong>objective</strong> of an ML algorithm is to find a line to draw through these points that <strong>minimizes the error</strong> in its predictions.</p>
<p>You can visualize the <strong>error</strong> as the distance from each real data point's <code>Y</code> coordinate to the <strong>prediction</strong>: the line's value at the corresponding <code>X</code> coordinate.</p>

<p>In this case, they can start with a proposed line to draw, calculate the error, and make a next guess about what the best line could be.</p>
<p>This process gets repeated, and if everything goes according to plan, the errors decrease.</p>

<p>As Brian Eno <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/649039-whatever-you-now-find-weird-ugly-uncomfortable-and-nasty-about">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Whatever you now find weird, ugly, uncomfortable, and nasty about a new medium will surely become its signature.</em></p>
<p><em>CD distortion, the jitteriness of digital video, the crap sound of 8-bit, all of these will be cherished and emulated as soon as they can be avoided. It’s the sound of failure.</em></p>
<p><em>So much modern art is the sound of things going out of control. Out of a medium, pushing to its limits and breaking apart.”</em></p>

<p>An algorithm trying to interpret a face shouldn't have to look at each individual pixel.</p>
<p>If you squint your eyes, you can usually still make out whether you're looking at someone familiar, right?</p>
<p>In this case, the researchers behind Eigenfaces wanted to "decompose" images of faces into their essential components, so that algorithms could deal directly with those abstract "components" rather than looking at every single pixel. <!-- (using the [Eigenvectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors), hence the name). --></p>
